# Java-Final-Project
The Java final project was a program that allowed a user to choose two different ciphers in order to decrypt and decrypt message. The project emphasized OOP concepts.
The Cipher file contains the abstract class for the two ciphers.
The CodeProgram file contains the class that had the main program for the message encryption, and it is menu-driven.
The MessageDecoder file and the MessageEncoder file are the interfaces that had the functions each cipher class should implement.
The ShuffleCipher file contains the class that had all the properties for decrypting and encrypting a message using a shuffle cipher.
The SubstitutionCipher file contains the class that had all the properties for decrypting and encrypting a message using a substitution cipher.
