# Java-Final-Project
The Java final project was a program that allowed a user to choose two different ciphers in order to decrypt and decrypt message. The project emphasized OOP concepts.
Cipher file: Abstract class for the two ciphers.
CodeProgram file: Class that had the main program for the message encryption. Menu-driven.
MessageDecoder file: Interface that had the functions each cipher class should implement.
MessageEncoder file: Interface that ahd the functions each cipher class should implement.
ShuffleCipher file: Class that had all the properties for decrypting and encrypting a message using a shuffle cipher.
SubstitutionCipher file: Class that had all the properties for decrypting and encrypting a message using a substitution cipher.
